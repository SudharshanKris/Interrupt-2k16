            <p class="flow-text left-align thin">
             <br>
Brace yourself for an exciting event as we unravel the mysteries of two of the most popular programming languages, C and C++! If you're a coder, there is no better place for you than Code Ninja!

<br>
It's time to showcase your coding skills while we take you through the rounds. Solve puzzles and crack code to find your way to glory!
                
<br>
                <br><b>Round 1</b><br>
The first round consists of objective type questions related to the concepts of C and C++. Choose the correct option or enter the answers to the questions in the space provided. Get a top score to slide into Round 2!<br>
               <br> <b>Round 2</b>
              
<br>
 Participants will recieve 15 questions, 5 easy, 5 medium and 5 hard and a challenge question. This round is flexible, participants get to choose  the questions that they have to solve and the number of questions that they have to solve.
<br>
Participants are scored as follows:
<ul class="flow-text left-align thin">
<li>Easy-20</li>
<li>Medium-30</li>
<li>Hard-50</li>
<li>Challenge-100</li>
</ul>
<span class="flow-text left-align thin">
The first participant/team to reach 100 points wins!<br><br>
                <b>Rules</b><br>
                1)You may code in C or Java only.<br>
                2)You may participate as team of two or alone.<br>
                3)The decision of the coordinators is final.<br>

            <h2 class="text-center">GAME OF ARCHIVES</h2>
            <p class="flow-text left-align thin">
                Imagine you're watching an episode of Sherlock. What happens in every case? Evidence and red herrings pop up willy-nilly and we try to solve the case along with Sherlock and Watson. In the end, you'd have noticed what cracks the case would be the seemingly harmless scribble on the book which lies open during the murder. Every piece of information provides clues to the most complex problems.

<br>
Recorded details of the past prove to be the ultimate evidence for the present. Tables are a tool and an archive is a library of data. Do you have what it takes to become a DBA?

                <br>
                Here's an opportunity you wouldn't want to miss! Put your database skills to the test and show us who's boss! Create tables that could change the way we perceive and extract information. Normalize your data to achieve supreme efficiency. This game is going to be intense!!  
<br>
                <br>
                <b>Round 1: Query Round</b><br>
This is the qualifying round that takes place on site. Just write some queries and you could be part of the epic battle!

<br>
                <br>
            <b>Round 2: Scenario Round</b><br>
Here's where the real challenge lies! Create an apt database for the scenario we give you and add some of your own personal pizazz to it! 
             <br>  <br>
<b>Rules</b><br>
1.	Basic knowledge of MySQL queries is expected (select, insert, create, etc.). Knowledge of higher concepts would be appreciated.<br>
2.	This is a team event.  A team of 2 is required to take part in this event.<br>
3.	Round 2 will be solely judged on how relevant the content of your tables is with the given scenario. <br>

            <br>

                <br>
What is data? Is it letters? Is it numbers? Is it a combination of both? Or is it something completely abstract? Everything, right from alphabets to copies of the Oxford dictionary, from the number of times your cat sneezed, to the cat videos on YouTube, is data! 
<br>
So how do we store all this data?
<br>                
Does your brain automatically link nodes in the form of lists or do you prefer your data is the neat branches of a tree? Can you translate those diagrams into segments of code? Put those hours you spent on CodeChef and HackerRank to use at Data D-Queue!
<br>
<br>
<br> <b>Round 1</b><br>
20 minute, 20 questions. Simple. Qualifiers will move on to Round 2!

 <br><b>Round 2</b><br>
 Data structure based programming round.

<b>Rules</b><br>

<p class="flow-text left-align thin">
How would  you survive against a wild bear if you just have just a blanket, a broomstick and an ice-cream sandwich? Can you decrypt coded messages? Can you come up with algorithms on the fly to save the day? 

<br><br>
If your answer to any of the above questions is yes, then only one thing remains to be decided. Are you worthy of being the Don of Logic?
<br>
<br>
<b>Round 1: Written Test</b><br>
You have 30 minutes to answer 20 lateral thinking questions. 16 possible Dons will move to the next round. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Round 2: Quiz</b><br>
Each Don-hopeful is given 5 cards. The card will have a daily household object like a blanket or a broomstick. There is one special (Wild) card, which has all the objects (Tools). 
The quiz master poses a survival question, and each player has to take out an answer card and place it face down. Once all the players have done so, each player has to show what tool they used and how they used that tool. Only if the explanation is correct will the player be awarded a point. Each player will now be given a new card (can be any tool) from the pack.
The first six players to reach 13 points advance to the final round.

The first six players to reach 13 points advance to the final round.<br>
               

<b>Round 3: Coding with a twist</b><br>
Finalists will be given a question and 45 minutes to write, compile and execute a simple program the answers the question. The program can be written in C or C++ as per the participant’s choice. The winner of this round is the of Don Of Logic! <br>
